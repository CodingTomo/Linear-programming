# Linear programming

Inspiered by the [nurse scheduling problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_scheduling_problem) and the recent government restrictions due to the pandemic, I developed a linear model in order to shedule the shifts of a "project-driven" company maximizing an objective function that depends on a list of KPIs.

The algorithm mainly uses the [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) library.
